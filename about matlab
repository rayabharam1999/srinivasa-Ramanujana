MATLAB is a matrix laboratory developed by MathWorks.
Although MATLAB is intended primarily for numerical computing, an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine, allowing access to symbolic computing abilities.
An additional package, Simulink, adds graphical multi-domain simulation and model-based design for dynamic and embedded systems.
Variables are defined using the assignment operator, =. MATLAB is a weakly typed programming language because types are implicitly converted.[12] It is an inferred typed language because 
variables can be assigned without declaring their type, except if they are to be treated as symbolic objects,[13] and that their type can change. Values can come from constants, from computation involving values of other variables, or from the output of a function
